# EmulatorAutomation

* This notebook contains a series of basic functions that can be used to detect pixels, recognize images, and send taps and swipes to an android emulator. These functions can be combined into loops to create automated sequences. The basic functions will work for all games and apps you might want to automate. There are some more complex functions and loops in the notebook specific to Another Eden.

* In order to use it, you will need to unzip the files in `adb.zip` into the same directory that the ipynb notebook is in.

* If people want to use this as a basis for more robust farming functions for Another Eden or some other game, please make them available to everyone. Send pull requests so I can merge them into the main script or open an issue and I'll manually merge it myself.
