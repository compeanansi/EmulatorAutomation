# EmulatorAutomation

* This notebook contains a series of basic functions that can be used to detect pixels, recognize images, and send taps and swipes to an android emulator. These functions can be combined into loops to create automated sequences.

* There is sample code in the notebook for some basic bot functions for Another Eden. If people want to use this as a basis for more robust farming functions, please send pull requests so I can merge them into the main script or open an issue and I'll manually merge it myself.
